# Roxie, a bibliography builder

![Roxie rocks Chicago](https://github.com/gswirrl/roxie/blob/master/doc/roxie.jpg?raw=true)

## Description

Roxie is a bibliography and citation formatter for the wretched, misconceived, benighted poison that is the Chicago notes and bibliography citation style.

Status: Hey, I just started. This is under heavy development and doesn't do anything useful yet. Also, it's a quick hack. I need it in ten days' time ðŸ˜¬ so code quality? Not my main priority here, mmkay.

## To run

cd ~/Documents/roxie/api; 
yarn start;

cd ~/Documents/roxie/client; 
yarn start;

open 'http://0.0.0.0:3000'
